# Snake_Game_Python
Hey there! This is my Python Snake game project built with Tkinter, and Iâ€™m super excited about it! Itâ€™s got both single-player and two-player modes, so you can play solo or challenge a friend. You move the snake to gobble up apples, grow longer, and try not to crash into walls or yourself. I added some cool stuff like a main menu, custom images (backgrounds, apples, hearts), and a leaderboard to save your best scores. The two-player mode is awesomeâ€”each player gets their own side of the screen, with Player 1 using arrow keys and Player 2 using WASD. Thereâ€™s also a lives system, game-over screens, and a settings menu to reset the leaderboard.

Whatâ€™s in it:

Single-Player Mode: Eat apples, rack up points, and survive with 3 lives.
Two-Player Mode: Go head-to-head with a friend on split screens.
Leaderboard: Saves the top 5 scores in a JSON file so you can brag about your high score.
Fancy UI: I used custom fonts, buttons, and images to make it look nice.
Settings: You can reset the leaderboard if you want a fresh start.
Smooth Controls: The snake moves nicely, and I made sure you canâ€™t cheat by reversing into yourself.
What You Need:

Python 3 (I used 3.10, but others should work)
Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
Pillow for the images (pip install Pillow)
How to Play:

Clone or download this repo.
Make sure you have the image files (main_menu_background.png, game_background.png, apple.png, score_icon.png, heart.png) in the same folder as the code.
Install Pillow if you havenâ€™t: pip install Pillow
Run the game with python snake_game.py
I had a blast making this, and I hope you enjoy playing it! If youâ€™ve got ideas to make it better or find any bugs, let me know. Feel free to fork it and mess around with the code! ðŸ˜„
